Hi! It's Arduino game that's using potentiometer.
Modules needed:
Arduino Nano;
OLED 128x32 I2C display;
Potentiometer (I have linear potentiometer, so it works better);
Active buzzer.

Features:
Saving high-score in EEPROM;
Retro sound effects;
Smooth moving;
Pixel-art style.

Pins:
Buzzer - D3;
Potentiometer - A0;

How to play:
When the game starts, move your potentiometer and platform will start moving with it! You need to collect as many bubbles as you can. You have three hearts in upper right corner and score in the upper left. If you miss three bubbles, you lose.

I think that's all! Hope you will like my game cuz I worked on it quite long time.
If you have any ideas how improve the game or you noticed a bug - let me know!
